# 📊 ChurnLens: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Companies often use customer churn analysis and customer churn rates as one of their key business metrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than the cost of acquiring a new one.Hence, The process to analyze customer needs retention plays a significant part in improving the company's growth, protects loyal customers, and improve its customer relationship management (CRM). 
 As a data analyst, my job is to provide an in-depth analysis of  Telecom’s churn dataset and to answer the following questions

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
✅ What is the overall churn rate?  
✅ Which services have the highest churn rate?  
✅ What is the revenue lost due to churn?  
✅ Does contract type affect churn rate?  
✅ How do customer demographics impact churn?

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information, service usage, and churn status.

- **Total Customers:** `7043`
- **Key Features:** Customer tenure, monthly charges, demographics, location, internet/phone services, additional services (e.g., security, backup), and churn status.
- **Data Sources:** https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113.



## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Database:**  MySQL
- **Query Language:** SQL
<img src="IMAGES/mysql logo.png" alt="mysql_img.png" width="200"/> &nbsp;

### **1️⃣ Database Setup**
- Created the **`telecom_customer`** database.
- Designed multiple **normalized tables**:
  - **`demographics`** → Customer details (age, gender, dependents).
  - **`location`** → Customer location details.
  - **`population`** → Population data linked via zip codes.
  - **`status`** → Customer churn status and scores.
  - **`services`** → Services subscribed, contract types, and financial details.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE telecom_customer;
USE telecom_customer;
```

---

### **2️⃣ Data Import & Verification**
- Imported data into tables.
- Ran `SELECT` queries to verify successful imports.
- Checked for **duplicate records** to ensure data integrity.

```sql
SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_check
FROM demographics 
GROUP BY Customer_ID
HAVING duplicate_check > 1;
```

✅ **Outcome:** No duplicate records were found.

---

### **3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Checked for NULL values** in each table.
- **Verified referential integrity** between tables.
- **Dropped unnecessary columns** (e.g., redundant `count` columns).

```sql
ALTER TABLE demographics DROP COLUMN count;
```

✅ **Outcome:** Clean, structured dataset with accurate relationships.

---

### **4️⃣ Establishing Relationships (Foreign Keys)**
- Defined **Foreign Key Constraints** to link tables and ensure **data consistency**.
- Connected `Customer_ID` across multiple tables and `Zip_Code` for location validation.

```sql
ALTER TABLE telecom_customer.demographics
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_demo_service_CustId
FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES telecom_customer.services(Customer_ID);
```

✅ **Outcome:** All tables correctly linked, preventing orphan records.
